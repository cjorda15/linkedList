###Linked List project

Build the list with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This list of links will add website titles and links to "cards" that show the information.

The user must enter something into both the website title and website url fields or they will get an error.

The links on the cards turn yellow on hover.

A card can be marked read and then marked unread again.

The page resets on page load.
